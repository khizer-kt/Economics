Basic Functionalities that we MAY use in this project:  
- Searching for an item, using a hashtable or binary search tree  
- Sorting items by price or name (quicksort or mergesort)  
- Add or remove items in the dataset (dynamic array)  
- Calculate the total cost of a shopping cart (Heap or queue)  
- Recommendations, we can use graphs to represent relationships between items for recommending  
- Sales Commission, using hashtables we can store the sales commission codes and corresponding commission rates  
- Generating reports on sales and customer data: We can use a data structure such as a binary search tree to store and organize the sales data by various criteria (e.g., customer ID, fiscal year, category)  
- Implementing a loyalty program: We can use a data structure such as a heap to store and prioritize customer data based on their "customer since" date  
- Implementing a feature that allows users to filter and sort the items in the dataset: We can use a data structure such as a priority queue to store and prioritize the items in the dataset based on various criteria (e.g., price, quantity)
