~~**Stage:4**~~  
~~5:05 AM 31st December~~  
~~Winding up the work from last two days~~  
~~- Fixed the AVL code~~  
~~- Included [hash.h](https://github.com/khizer-kt/Economics/blob/main/hash.h)~~  
~~This file is creating a hash function by getting the item_id from the CSV file then converting that id into an integer, passing it to a hash function that will give its location.~~

~~**Stage:3**~~  
~~8:26 PM 29th December~~  
~~AVL Files Added~~  
~~Parser File Upgraded to Parse data into AVL~~

~~**Stage:2**~~

~~Basic Functionalities that we MAY use in this project:~~  
~~- Searching for an item, using a hashtable or binary search tree~~  
~~- Sorting items by price or name (quicksort or mergesort)~~  
~~- Add or remove items in the dataset (dynamic array)~~  
~~- Calculate the total cost of a shopping cart (Heap or queue)~~  
~~- Recommendations, we can use graphs to represent relationships between items for recommending~~  
~~- Sales Commission, using hashtables we can store the sales commission codes and corresponding commission rates~~  
~~- Generating reports on sales and customer data: We can use a data structure such as a binary search tree to store and organize the sales data by various criteria (e.g., customer ID, fiscal year, category)~~  
~~- Implementing a loyalty program: We can use a data structure such as a heap to store and prioritize customer data based on their "customer since" date~~  
~~- Implementing a feature that allows users to filter and sort the items in the dataset: We can use a data structure such as a priority queue to store and prioritize the items in the dataset based on various criteria (e.g., price, quantity)~~

~~**Stage:1** SCRAPPED~~   
~~1:24 AM 16th December Code commited by [Khizer](https://github.com/khizer-kt)~~  
~~- For now we are getting the data from CSV file into LinkedList and each and every data field (cell) is treated as a separate Node~~
